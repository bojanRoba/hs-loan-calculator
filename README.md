This is the *Loan Calculator* project I made myself.


<p>Personal finance can be tricky, but it doesn't have to be! This project helps you understand loans and mortgages with a handy calculator. Just provide a few details like loan amount, interest rate, and payment terms. The program will calculate key financial parameters, making informed decisions easier. You can determine your monthly payment, the total interest paid, or the loan amount you can afford.<br>
Plus, it's a great way to understand the command-line interface. So, ditch those complex spreadsheets and let our calculator simplify your finances, one calculation at a time. Get ready to become your own financial guru!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/90?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/90</a>
